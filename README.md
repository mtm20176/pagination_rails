pagination_rails
================

You got a honking ActiveRecord result and want to let users page through the result? Read on.

Overview
The general gist looks like you need to first, set a configuration in the model to limit records returned per query, second adjust the controller or  scope in the model, to use the pagination, third in the ERB, create a partial for the paginated results <%= render @bookmarks %>, followed by a div with id infinite-scrolling, with <%= will_paginate %>

Gem file
```
## pagination
gem 'will_paginate', '~> 3.0'
```
be sure to run:
```
bundle install
```
Model
optional to add this( I put in Controller )
```
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

  self.per_page = 20
```
Controller

# set per_page globally, or optionally in the ActiveRecord - see 2nd example below.
```
WillPaginate.per_page = 20

@posts = Post.paginate(:page => params[:page])
```
OR
```
@posts = Post.paginate(:page => params[:page], :per_page => 20)
```

Within ERB/View

To show the nice page count with links, put it after your loop through the model result.  I ended up removing the :page_links => false so I could see the page numbers for faster navigation.
```
<%= will_paginate @posts, :page_links => false %>
```
